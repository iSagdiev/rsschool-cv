            <li> I want to become Junior Developer. I’ve made decision to learn Developing due to wide opportunities in the field and my own desires to challenge myself and learn something new. 
                To be developer, means <b>non-stop studying of the new technologies and approaches</b> which inspires me and shows that different issues can be solved in several ways. 
                Also it improves the way of thinking and logic. I think IT Developing is our future and I want to be a part of it.</li>
