3. I want to become Junior Frontend Developer. I’ve made decision to learn Developing due to wide opportunities in the field and my own desires to challenge myself and learn something new. To be developer, means non-stop studying of the new technologies and approaches which inspires me and shows that different issues can be solved in several ways. Also it improves the way of thinking and logic. I think IT Develiping is our future and I want to be a part of it.
